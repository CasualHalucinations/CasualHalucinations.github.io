                    The name is Cecília Felipiaki Medeiros, i'm a 16 year old teenager, im frequenting a school named CAIC Madezatti, i speak fluent english, i can read, write and understand it without much truble, but i can't say much about my pronounciantion because i never spoke to someone with english as their first language. i have a lot of free time so i spend my days just relaxing by either playing video-games or drawing. Im an aspiring artist, i love drawing and creating stories, it brings me joy and i would love for other people to see it and become inspired to create something too. I think people are really negative nowadays and i want to add a little bit more of positivity in the world.

                    I don't know about the future, i don't know what to expect from it and that kinda scares me. But i know i want to do something for animals,  my cats Julieta and Filipinas are one of the best things in my life, they keep me company and have bought me happines in dire moments, I'm thankfull for that, i love them and i know i want to make other animals feel loved.
